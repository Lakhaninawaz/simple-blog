                            <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-top: 0px;">On Nov. 11, the
                                group of Elon engineering students will deconstruct four structures made of canned goods
                                to be donated to SAFE.</p>
                            <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-top: 0px;">Griffin Chase, a
                                senior majoring in entrepreneurship with a minor in engineering design, is one of three
                                students partnering with SAFE. Chase said through this project, he has learned about
                                food insecurity in Alamance County.</p>
                            <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-top: 0px;">“We had to really
                                try to understand the issue that we're trying to solve,” Chase said. “We're really
                                looking to help people here. Our whole project is meant to serve other people.”</p>
                            <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-top: 0px;">The structures will
                                be built by students on Nov. 10 and 11, then deconstructed with aid by the community at
                                an event at the Culture Mill in Saxapahaw.</p>

                            <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-top: 0px;">Chase said he and
                                his partners have volunteered at SAFE and he attended a community hearing event where he
                                learned about the prominence of food insecurity in Alamance County.</p>
                            <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-top: 0px;">“People might not
                                have the means to get food, whether it's transportation or the money,” Chase said. “Some
                                people might be embarrassed to ask for help. They’d really prefer to figure it out
                                themselves.”</p>
                            <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-top: 0px;">According to
                                Tiffanie Jackson, executive director of SAFE, the nonprofit organization serves as a
                                community space for Alamance County and spends most of its budget on its two food
                                pantries, located in Graham and Saxapahaw.</p>
                            <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-top: 0px;">“Our goal is to
                                meet people where they are in their lives and partner with them to get them where they
                                want to be,” Jackson said.</p>
                            <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-top: 0px;">Jackson said SAFE
                                served over 7,000 food insecure people in 2022 and is projected to serve at least 10,000
                                by the end of 2023.</p>
                            <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-top: 0px;">According to

                                        Agriculture</u></a>, food insecurity is the condition of limited or inadequate
                                access to food. Jackson said the difference between hunger and food insecurity is not
                                having enough food versus having to make choices between food and other
                                necessities.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-top: 0px;">“You're having to
                                choose between food and some other basic thing that you need for your life,” Jackson
                                said. “Are you going to pay for child care or food? And oftentimes what happens when
                                people are food insecure is they get the least expensive — and most often least healthy
                                — thing because the least healthy foods are the least expensive to feed their families
                                and to just get calories into their kids.”</p>
                            <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-top: 0px;">According

                                of 2021, there is a food insecure population of 19,330 in Alamance County: 11.3% of the
                                population. Jackson also said 20% of children in Alamance County schools are food
                                insecure, and 40% of the population served at SAFE is made up of children.</p>
                            <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-top: 0px;">“We're trying to
                                work towards more healthy eating, but also, if you give a kid a good basic start, life's
                                easier,” Jackson said.</p>

                                professor Sirena Hargrove-Leak — who teaches EGR2100 — said the course is designed to
                                make engineering students think first about who they are designing for.</p>
                            <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-top: 0px;">“There are so many
                                examples of very well-meaning engineers designing something that is pretty much not
                                useful for the person they intended because they never considered the needs, desires and
                                wants of the person or the group,” Hargrove-Leak said.</p>
                            <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-top: 0px;">She said the course

                                when she originally started the course in 2015, she had four students and one project.
                                Now, she said she has 38 students and eight community partners with 12 different

                                grows, and we still have one semester, I really need to be thoughtful about scoping the
                                projects so that they are reasonable for completion in one semester, and we don't end up
                                disappointing people,” Hargrove-Leak said. “That weighed heavily on my conscience.”</p>
                            <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-top: 0px;">She said her
                                students enjoy the class because of its community connection.</p>
                            <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-top: 0px;">“Many of the
                                students really enjoy this opportunity because many are drawn to engineering because of
                                their desire to help people,” Hargrove-Leak said. “It's just a natural fit.”</p>
                            <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-top: 0px;">She said her
                                favorite part of the course is helping the community.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-top: 0px;">“We have the good
                                fortune of having a lot of knowledge and skill, and now we have facilities to be able to
                                design these things,” Hargrove-Leak said. “I feel like it's our duty to give back.”</p>
                            <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-top: 0px;">While EGR2100 is
                                required for the engineering design minor, Chase said he enjoys the class.</p>
                            <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-top: 0px;">“It's definitely
                                nice to do something that has a bit more of an impact than just getting a grade,” Chase
                                said.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-top: 0px;">He said the event
                                is meant to bring the community together.</p>
                            <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-top: 0px;">“We would like to
                                build these nice, big designs and we can't do them all ourselves — just the three of
                                us,” Chase said. “It's to get volunteers, to get people involved and interested.”&nbsp;
                            </p>
                            <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-top: 0px;">Jackson said the
                                event will benefit the community as a whole.</p>
                            <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-top: 0px;">“It helps you to
                                understand the entirety of the community where you're from, where you're living.
                                Alamance County isn't just Elon and it's not just Burlington,” Jackson said. “It helps
                                you understand the entirety of the community.”</p>
                            <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-top: 0px;">She said
                                volunteering is important — especially in a county with a prevalence of food insecurity.
                            </p>
                            <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-top: 0px;">“Someone you know
                                is food insecure,” Jackson said. “You're helping your neighbor.”</p>
